<img src="http://i.imgur.com/R2EZ901.png" alt="Jason Born Headshot" style="width:250;height:250;">
<p> The purpose of this website is to tell you a little bit about myself. My name is <strong>Jason Born</strong>, and I am a first year student at the University of Georgia. I was born in Manassas, Virginia, but grew up in Alpharetta, GA for sixteen years. My hobbies include skateboarding, photography, videography, and starting businesses. I started skateboarding in the fifth grade, and I still skateboard to this day.</p>
<p>I said that I liked starting businesses. I have my own company called Dapper Wraps. Dapper Wraps is a cooling towel company. We make high quality PVA towels with custom artwork. We are currently running a sale where towels are available for only <del>$19.99</del> <b>$9.99</b>! <br>If you would like to learn more, <a href="http://www.dapperwraps.com">check out my website!</a></p>

<p>Although Iâ€™m only a freshman and do enjoy <acronym title="Computer Science">CS</acronym>, I am fairly certain that I want to be a Business Management major with a certificate in Entrepreneurship. I know that if I am able to stick it out and get this degree, then I will be able to not only advance my own business, but possibly other businesses I will work for as well.</p>

<H3> My instructions for making the perfect peanut butter and jelly bagel sandwich</H3>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Take your favorite type of bagel.</li>
	<li>Cut your bagel in half.</li>
	<li>Spread a generous amount of peanut butter on one half of the bagel.</li>

	<li>Spread jelly <i>lightly</i> on the other half of the bagel.</li>
	<li>Put the halves together and enjoy!
